### My Requirements

For this project, I was instructed to apply my knowledge gained over four weeks and create a grocery list app in four hours. I was able to choose either PHP or Node.js. That was the easiest choice of my life as I'm not a fan of PHP. Other requirements were an MVC file structure, models with connection to a database (I chose Mongo), authentication (local or OAuth), JSON output of a user's grocery list (API), testing with Mocha / Chai, and use of templating (I chose Pug). The two required models were User and Item models. Required routes included "/signin", "/list", "/newitem", and "/api/{userid}". 


### Why I built it

Aside from the fact this was a final project for class, I built this to test my newly acquired skills. This was my first month learning Node.js and was a big challenge for having 0 previous knowledge.
